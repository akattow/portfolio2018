# about me

**Pardon the dust! I have migrated from my first hardcoded portfolio site to a new site built using Hugo. Legit blog posts forthcoming. Check back soon!**

I am currently developing responsive e-learning and designing interactive and blended learning experiences at the International Foundation for Employee Benefit Plans.

I'm a left-brain/right-brain hybrid type. I'm also a self-taught front-end developer and user experience designer.

I love developing digital experiences that help people explore, learn, and grow. Now, I use my expertise in user-centered design and development to create meaningful learning and educational products.

Technical toolset: HTML, CSS/Sass/Less, JavaScript, jQuery, Adapt Learning Framework, Hugo, and Bootstrap.

Creative toolset: Adobe Creative Suite, including Adobe XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Adobe Premier. Experience using Sketch, Figma, and Axure for wireframing, design, and prototyping.
