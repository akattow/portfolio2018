# about me

I am currently developing responsive e-learning and designing interactive and blended learning experiences at the International Foundation for Employee Benefit Plans.

I'm a left-brain/right-brain hybrid type. I'm also a self-taught front-end developer.

I love developing digital experiences that help people explore, learn, and grow. Now, I use my expertise in front-end development to create meaningful learning and educational products.

Technical toolset: JavaScript, React, jQuery, CSS3/Sass/Less/PostCss, HTML5, Python, C#, Adapt Learning Framework, Hugo, and Bootstrap.

Creative toolset: Visual Studio, VS Code, Adobe Creative Suite, including Adobe XD and Illustrator. Experience using Sketch, Figma, and Axure for wireframing, design, and prototyping.
